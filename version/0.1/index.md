_add reference to the RFC_ 

[JSTP URI Scheme](https://github.com/jstp/jstp-uri): An URI addressing specification for describing JSTP resources. Its ultimate aim is to describe JSTP with enough power to be used analogously as HTTP URLs are used by user agents for consuming HTTP resources.

### Requirements

The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "recommended", "may", and "optional" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Level _RFC 2119_](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more of the _must_ or _required_ level requirements for the protocols it implements. An implementation that satisfies all the _must_ or _required_ level and all the _should_ level requirements for its protocols is said to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the _must_ level requirements but not all the _should_ level requirements for its protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant."
